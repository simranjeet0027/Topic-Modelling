# Topic-Modelling-
Topic modelling using Latent Drichlet Algorithm(LDA).
Topic Modelling refers to a classification or distribution of topics over keywords, this
means whenever we search for a word or we search for a news article we may or
may not think how does the different news aricles get classified in different
categories . Wikipedia, inshorts, and some other news applications work under this
category. So this project will include the implementation of those algorithms and
techniques of ML and AI for modeling systems .We will be using NLP,LDA for this
project.
Algorithms used in Topic Modeling System and found there are two major systems:
1. NLP(Natural Language Processing ):

Cleaning Extracted Texts

The text extracted from the pdf document contains uninformative characters
which needs to be removed. These characters reduces the effectiveness of our
models as they provide unnecessary count ratios. The function below uses a
series of  regex  search and replace function as well as a list-comprehension to
replace these characters with a blank space. The functions below were used for
this process and the resulting document shown is seen to contain just
alphanumeric characters.

2.LDA (Latent Drichlet Algorithm) :
Topic Modeling and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in Python. Topic
modeling is a type of statistical modeling for discovering the abstract “topics”
that occur in a collection of documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an
example of topic model and is used to classify text in a document to a
particular topic.
